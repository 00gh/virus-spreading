# Virus Spreading

Simple virus spreading simulation inspired by this great [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) (written by Harry Stevens on [WashingtonPost](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)).\
The goal of this tool is to experiment with several parameters to see how to **"flatten the curve"** (Why does the curve need to be flattened in a pandemic? You can find the answer in the previously mentioned article, or search google because there are a lot of great articles).\
The whole simulation is made in plain JS and CSS.


**NOTE: Not final! Definitely needs a big refactoring (spaghetti code, I'll refactor in the next days)!!!**\
*PS: The readme will be updated with more detailed description after the refactoring.*
